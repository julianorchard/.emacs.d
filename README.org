* Emacs Configuration

I used to use Emacs a lot and now I use it barely at all! 

This configuration is a very cut down version of my old one. I used to
have a Literate configuration built into the rest of my dotfiles but
now I'm just using this simple elisp one (basically =use-package=
everything).

I now mainly use neovim and, for note taking,
[[https://logseq.com/][Logseq]].

I would like to use this again in place of Logseq at some point but
I'd rather invest my time elsewhere at the minute.
